> I don't watch ankle injuries.

Rough week to be a Cowboys fan, but on the bright side, Mark was able to snap Tarv's winning streak just like‚Ä¶ like‚Ä¶ damn, I can't think of an apt metaphor. Losing Dak hurts Mark's team, especially since his team is Cowboys lite. But, with Dallas's D/ST being awful, the offense will have to score to keep up, and he still has their number one weapon. Pair that with Mark getting Dak's replacement in the form of a scrub 2015 MVP, quality receivers, and a strong bench. Mark is number one until he isn't.

It may not be the sexiest team, but it gets the job done. Despite almost being overtaken by Elite Ryan Tannehill, my team pulled through with a win. My team may not put up eye-popping numbers, but my floor is low. With Mostert coming back in and Bell having the potential to be anywhere but the Jets, I think my team could continue to be sneaky good. If I can get past Trond on Kamara's bye week, I should be sitting pretty. I'm still the Sacko, and there is still a video to be owed, so I pray that karma doesn't bring down Kamara.

Cook going down was scary, but it doesn't look like he will be out long. Mattison has put up good numbers in the past with Cook out, and it hasn't affected his workload upon return, so I don't expect it to this time either. Travis has a strong RB corp plus Lockett and Parker. While not outstanding, they have been consistent, which is weird for both of them. A couple of classic Lockett breakouts matched that with MVP frontrunner Josh Allen making a strong comeback from a weak week, and I think Tarv could do the repeat.

> Thanks for not starting Mikey.

Who is carrying this team? Is it Lamar Jackson? James Conner? Michael Thomas? AJ Brown? No. Idiots. It's James Robinson and Jonathan Taylor, of course. Once Thomas is back, it might just be game over for all of us if his studs start pulling their weight. Did I mention Mike Williams got over 22 points while on the bench? Just like we all predicted‚Ä¶

## <FontAwesomeIcon className="levelDown" icon={faLevelDownAlt} /> These rankings are trash | 3-2W/L | 515PF

Carlough will complain that these 'rankings are trash,' but when your QB and RB1 score less than nine points combined, and neither had an injury,  you don't deserve to be any higher. Andrew has a scary set of WRs, but outside of that, I don't see much positive about this team, especially once McCaffrey gets healthy and sends Davis back to the Shadow Realm. This team won't get far without a quality starting running back, even if you do put up the high score once in a while.

Chris had a poor showing this week, but this team is not far off from being fully healthy and the scariest team in the league again. He has three high-quality running backs and Mahomes. Even with Cooper looking not too hot, especially now that Dak is out, this team will be tough for anyone to beat. I don't have him higher because his bench strength is hurting, as you saw this week. Maybe you should talk to Carlough about upgrading a wide receiver. Just don't trade with John.

It was a good turnout this week, no doubt, and that was with Adams and Jones on bye weeks. You're playing from a tough spot right now. I want to rank you higher just because your Freeman bet paid off, and Ekeler will be back soon. However, your bench is as strong as they are in the weight room, and your receivers leave much to be desired. Even with Devante back, a touchdown from him means Aaron Jones doesn't get one.

This team has so much potential, but K-Man's choice to pick fifth instead of fourth continues to haunt him. CEH hasn't looked all that special, and it's rumored the Chiefs might even bring in Bell. Wouldn't that be hilarious? Ridley has been a pleasant surprise, and Carson has been consistent, but until the team can put it all together, it's going to be hard to win consistently. Tannehill is not going to put up 30 every week. Did I mention Kamara is the number one running back?

> I'll trade you Mark Ingram for the rest of your pho. That way, I can get something meaningful for him, at least.

I feel like this is where teams start to fall off a cliff. Everyone above this spot wouldn't surprise me if they took home the trophy. The Joe Burrow experiment was fun, I'm sure. Instead of trading me for Herbert, you decide that Goff is going to bring you the championship. How's that logic working out for the Rams? Outside of Henry and Diggs, there is not much on this team to get excited about.

This team could have been in a pretty good spot with a few waiver pickups and maybe actually trying to shop Bell. Trond is the BoB of this league and can't manage a team for shit. His two starting running backs are my starting running backs' backups. That should tell you all you need to know.

I have Mixon in my other league, and I'm doing just as terrible as John. So I feel ya, man. I don't think even Russel can save this team. On the bright side, OBJ finally looks like himself again, and Julio could come back and help. But God, the rest of this team is just a mess.

Poor Logan. Even when he does well, he loses. Honestly, I think this team is better than its record, and I would probably bet on Logan to win against any of the above three teams on any given week. But with Green and JuJu disappointing this season and Lindsay out, it has been challenging to fill flex spots with any talent. 0-5 is a tough spot to come back from and deserves nothing more than last in the power rankings. That said, I don't think the Sacko is in Logan's future this year.
