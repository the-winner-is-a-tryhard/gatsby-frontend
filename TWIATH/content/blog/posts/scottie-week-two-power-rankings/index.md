There's a new number one team in town. Tarv's team looks excellent from top to bottom right now. Alexa, play *Back to Back* by Drake.

Clyde Edwards-Helaire has a down week, and K-Man still posts 115 on me. Once he stops being a homer and drops Matthew Stafford, this will be a truly elite team. The playoff drought will be ending soon.

Caleb has had back-to-back baller weeks, and I'm very impressed. There are two concerns that I have with this team: David Johnson and the median point value. There's a lot of boom or bust, but the boom has masked the bust so far. I question how sustainable this will be in the long term.

It's hard to have a bad week when your QB posts a 40-piece. There's not much to complain about here. Mark's team is looking deep. The margin of difference between the top four teams is minimal right now.

This was a tough loss. I'm not writing off Chris by any means, but it's hard to deny that the Christian McCaffrey injury won't impact this team's elite status. I think this team has depth, but replacing the first overall pick will be a challenge. If Jerrick McKinnon can be a quality stopgap and Kareem Hunt keeps trending up, I think Crams will shoot right back up to the top. There's still an insane amount of talent on this team, but I still think the margins are so thin between the top teams.

I'm still not very high on this team's running backs. I'm very interested to see how Ronald Jones's role will be affected by Leonard Fournette's big game. I've already praised this team's receivers, but Matt Ryan's near 30-piece was kind enough to mask some deficiencies this week instead of Mark Andrews. Maybe this team is just mediocre instead of terrible.

I have no idea what the hell this team is and do not care to speculate. Uncle Cral is low-key the best manager in the league.

John is one Russell Wilson away from the Sacko. In typical John luck, he eeks out a win with ~10 points from his running backs and 2.4 from his WR1. Three of the four wide receivers he played this week had touchdowns. Saquon tearing his ACL was the MVP of this team too. I don't understand how John gets so lucky in fantasy football. I want to say that it's not sustainable, but we all know he's going to get into the playoffs with this doo doo team somehow.

It was a very tough week for Logz, and I'm not convinced it was a fluke. Deshaun Watson understandably didn't perform well against an elite defense behind a typical Texans offensive line and had no one to throw to. Everyone on this roster underperformed except Josh Jacobs. Logz direly needs some rushing touchdowns from his quarterback and Todd Gurley, Juju Smith-Schuster, and AJ Green to form a strong core.

I feel bad for Trondheim. This team has some solid pieces in Kyler Murray, Darren Waller, DK Metcalf, and Mike Evans, but injuries have decimated it. If Trond plays the waiver well, I could see him rising to mediocrity.

My team is officially terrible. For the second week, I leave a 20-piece on the bench, which makes me want to rank my team higher (and gives me the faintest glimmer of hope). At this point, my first-round, second-round, and third-round picks could all be considered busts. I don't have a reliable WR2, and my star tight end is injured. I'm already streaming QBs and will probably begin streaming D/STs as well with the terrible performance by the Saints against a mediocre offense.
