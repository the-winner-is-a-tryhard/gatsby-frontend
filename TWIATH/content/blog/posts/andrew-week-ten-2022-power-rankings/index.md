## Preamble

Amarillo Fact of the Week: The settlement originally was called Oneida; it later changed its name to Amarillo, which derives from yellow wildflowers that were plentiful during the spring and summer or the nearby Amarillo Lake and Amarillo Creek, named in turn for the yellow soil along their banks and shores.

And with that, the most yellow of Power Rankings one could be thankful for. In honor of the upcoming Thanksgiving Holiday, I share with you Andrew’s Thanksgiving Golden Utensil Power Rankings.

### Week Ten Points: 93.64

![golden-serving-fork.png](golden-serving-fork.png)

#### Golden Serving Fork

The most elite of the Thanksgiving utensils. The golden serving fork is reserved for the finest oven golden turkey. It has multiple very strong and dagger like teeth, perfect for injecting itself into the prey that would be that nice roasted bird. There is nothing this utensil cannot do. That is my team...

### Week Ten Points: 107.95

![golden-knife.png](golden-knife.png)

#### Golden Knife

Oh, the golden knife, how it perfectly sits in one’s hand to slice the perfect load of bread or to cut through a delicious butter biscuit. That is Scottie’s team, it has so many teeth you aren’t sure which one is going to cut you from week to week. You should be afraid of this utensil as in the wrong hands it could kill you.

### Week Ten Points: 121.03

![golden-salad-tongs.png](golden-salad-tongs.png)

#### Golden Salad Tongs

The golden salad tongs, many undervalue this utensil. Fear not though as this utensil while may not be able to carry the heaviest weight of Thanksgiving food I assure you it carries the largest volume. This was Callen’s team for most of the year, with some recent injuries we will see if one of the sides of the tong becomes slotted and starts to leak.

### Week Ten Points: 89.43

![golden-slotted-spoon.png](golden-slotted-spoon.png)

#### Golden Slotted Spoon

Oh Trond, Trond, Trond, Trond. You sir are the golden slotted spoon. While arguably an important utensil, as with the liquid in any Thanksgiving side dish wins seem to just fall through the cracks with you and your team. You just have to hope that the rest of the points your spoon holds can take you to the Cathy.

### Week Ten Points: 96.75

![golden-meat-fork.png](golden-meat-fork.png)

#### Golden Meat Fork

Similar to the all-mighty severing fork, the golden meat fork is quite the Thanksgiving utensil. The only down side is it really only has 2 points. That is Travis’ team, he only has 2 players that are really worth anything.

| Name                | Team    | Depth |

### Week Ten Points: 99.77

![golden-spoon.png](golden-spoon.png)

#### Golden Spoon

If you know anything about Thanksgiving feasts you know spoons are hit or miss. If the chef prepared soup or a casserole it may get more love than other times. This also applies to Logan’s team, he has potential to be feared by many.

| Name                 | Team   | Depth |

### Week Ten Points: 143.64

![golden-dinner-fork.png](golden-dinner-fork.png)

#### Golden Dinner Fork

Mark is the golden dinner fork. The most used and abused of all utensils. His team has been beaten up by various opponents and yet he had found a way to win a few match-ups. I expect to see him finish stronger in the Thanksgiving feast, compared to how he started.

| Name                | Team    | Depth |
| ------------------- | ------- | ----- |
| Justin Fields       | CHI-QB  | 1     |

### Week Ten Points: 116.75

![golden-dinner-knife.png](golden-dinner-knife.png)

#### Golden Dinner Knife

The golden dinner knife can wield power as long as the edge stays sharp. With the one pointy thing on Carl’s team injured he will need to find new sharpness to start cutting before he finds himself like his close brother the dull butter knife.

| Name                | Team    | Depth |

| Tua Tagovailoa      | MIA-QB  | 1 (O) |

### Week Ten Points: 75.53

![golden-pastry-server.png](golden-pastry-server.png)

#### Golden Pastry Server

Matt and his team are about as sweet as the pie that this golden pastry server transfers from the dish to your plate. And at Thanksgiving that is pumpkin pie, which is not sweet. Part poor management and poor players there isn’t much to this utensil, you get what you see.

| Name              | Team    | Depth |

### Week Ten Points: 84.1

![golden-butter-knife.png](golden-butter-knife.png)

#### Golden Butter Knife

Then there is Cramsey and his golden butter knife of a team. Lacking both cutting teeth and length, his team managed to have more people put up less than 6 points than those putting up more than 10. This utensil does nothing more than spread lackluster butter across one of the worst parts about Thanksgiving.

### Week Ten Points: 115.35

![golden-dessert-spoon.png](golden-dessert-spoon.png)

#### Golden Dessert Spoon

John is the golden dessert spoon. It is small and feeble and also setup far away from the main event of the Thanksgiving meal. While used for some of the sweetness at the end of a meal, John is too far away to get to taste of the Cathy this year.

| Name             | Team    | Depth |

### Week Ten Points: 101.37

![golden-ice-bucket.png](golden-ice-bucket.png)

#### Golden Ice Bucket

Lastly you have the Golden ice bucket. At first glance you look at the golden ice bucket and think “Wow” this thing is impressive. It’s so large and it holds the finest of champagne. Well do not be confused, at the end of the day this is a trashcan. A trashcan for ice, which when melted is worthless water. That is pretty much Caleb’s team...
