### Week Six Points: 128.13

Topping off the charts with 748 PF is Scottie. This team looks as unstoppable as the 2005 Texas Longhorns. The scary part is points are distributed around the whole team. The bench even appears to have some serviceable contributors in times of need. Barring some very bad luck, this team may very well be headed to the Rose Bowl to battle for the championship.

> Most PA and second highest PF. I should be no lower than 4th.

### Week Six Points: 112.96

Can't believe I'm doing this, but the numbers speak for themselves. The offensive unit on this team reminds me a lot of the 1916 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, the historic team that beat Cumberland 222-0. The only main difference is that team went 8-0-1 (LOL @ the 7-7 tie to Washington & Lee), while Trond's team is scraping by at 1-5 and 661 PF. It pains me to see Miles Sanders putting up monster numbers after I had so much patience with him last year. Alas, you win some you lose some. If Trond can start putting together some Dubs, he may fight his way back into the outright playoff picture. He certainly looks to be a contender for the PF spots.

### Week Six Points: 84.51

Under normal circumstances, I would rank this team way lower based on the eye test of the roster. But I can't argue the 649 PF he's put up this season, and I have no reason to believe that will decrease. If Lincoln Riley taught us anything, it's that Offense Wins Championships and Defense Doesn't Matter At All. Yeah yeah, that's not really panning out for him at USC as of last weekend, but in the case of both Lincoln and Andrew we have learned that scheduling a Charmin Soft schedule helps a lot. I don't know where the points will come from going forward, but with the unbelievable 6-0 start Andrew has some breathing room to figure that out. With regard to the top 4 playoff spots, a dub is a dub. Unlike OU, Andrew is in great position to make the playoffs.

### Week Six Points: 88.26

Surprisingly, Callen's team had a down week this week moving his squad to a respectable 4-2 on the season. The good news is when 88 points is a disappointment, you are in good shape. The other bit of good news is that you don't have Appalachian State on your schedule. Like the Texas A&M Aggies every year, heading into week 7 we must ask ourselves the question of which team will we get down the stretch? Callen's team has put up some monster numbers this year so far, clocking in at 619 PF to date. If he stays the course, it seems like a playoff spot is imminent.

### Week Six Points: 128.4

Understandably, Logz was kind of busy this weekend (Congrats again, Logz!). Regardless, his team decided to give him another reason to celebrate by grabbing the highest PF of the week with a whopping 128. That brings his PF on the season to a quite respectable 617. Much like OU's opponents this season, points this week were distributed generously all over the place which is good to see in a potential playoff contender. At 3-3 he's certainly in the mix to take one of the top 4 spots, and if not he should have a shot at the PF spots if his team continues to play well. Might wanna check on Robbie Anderson tho, dude went absolutely off the rails on the sideline this week. Big brain move keeping him on your bench.

### Week Six Points: 100.12

Xylophone sounds in the distance is what I heard after getting my first dub in 5 attempts this week bringing me to 2-4. Big shout out to the Denver Broncos for laying another egg and not utilizing Melvin Gordon while doing so. At 607 PF, while respectable, it is looking more and more like that may be my only shot at the playoffs this season. While not unrealistic to make the playoffs outright, I'm gonna have to transform into the Kansas State Wildcats real quick so I can start actually winning with some consistency. Jimmy Neutron move starting Deon Jackson this week really helped me out. Gonna have to start getting clever on the waiver if I want to break into the mix. Go Cats.

### Week Six Points: 82.44

Great job by Michael Pittman this week with a monster game. But, like a lot of Jimbo Fisher's in-game adjustments, did it really matter in the end? With John having a down week, Tarv's team easily moved to 4-2 on the season with 602 PF registered. Very much in the mix for an outright playoff spot, but if the pack catches him, he better hope for some Johnny Manziel numbers int the PF column down the stretch. Right now though, much like Jimbo on a 10 year contract, there's not much to be worried about.

### Week Six Points: 73.24

OU beat an overrated CFB team this week, but the Dollar General (Booty) Box Fans couldn't replicate the magic. Granted, Mrak had 4 players OUT on his bench, but it's next-man-up mentality for the Box Fans. In one of the lower scoring battles of the week, Mrak was edged out by an underwhelming squad that continues to defy the odds. Hard to believe we witness a fantasy match-up where Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady combine for fewer points than Trevor Lawrence, but here we are. At 2-4 and 591 PF, Mrak is gonna have to harness some Sooner Magic and start putting up some points and/or dubs. It's a long season, so anything is possible.

> My rule is backfiring.

### Week Six Points: 71.64

Contrary to his previous 2 weeks, Geno Smith did not have a good game, which put this already hamstrung team (due to byes) into a poor position. It was a valiant effort by Claeb's team in the loss, but Logan had all the magic this week. With a 2-4 record and 589 PF, he's in the same position as the Denver Broncos and many teams in this league are. Not last, in the mix, but time to kick it into gear. He's gaining some key contributors off bye next week which should help him a lot.

### Week Six Points: 88.65

Another week, another Kirk Cousins disappointment. The QBs this week in general did pretty poor, so it's not like he's the only one. Tough week for Carl this week, losing winnable games with his fantasy team and the Chiefs. Kelce had a great game but I was just waiting for him to pop off the whole time. Melvin Gordon essentially laying an egg on Monday night with the Broncos sealed the deal for this team. Like the Chiefs, Carl controls his own destiny. He is in the exact same situation nearly half the league is at 2-4 and 589 PF. Lots of runway left in the season, may the best manager win the coveted playoff spots.

> My team got bad fast.

### Week Six Points: 53.69

The rapid decline of this team is truly shocking. While John was impacted by byes this week, the team could only muster 53 points including 20 from Mark Andrews. With John though, we all know he should never be counted out. At 3-3 and 588 PF, he's certainly in the mix with the 1 game advantage on half the league. I think John and I have been turning in fantasy karma for KSU Wildcat karma and I'm fully here for it. Cats by 90 this weekend.

### Week Six Points: 116.65

Sheesh K-Man, with 116 this week to edge out Trond, I could see this team moving up the rankings in a flash. Lawrence and Diggs balled out, and contributions came from nearly everywhere. At 2-4 and 570 PF, K-Man's squad is right there with half the league. Much like the Golden Hurricane, although with a slow start, K-Man is still certainly in the mix for postseason play.
