Cramsey cashed in all his football karma to beat me in both this league and the golf league. Unfortunately, because of this, K-State got torched by Arkansas State. Chris's team underperformed and still got a hundo points. Patrick Mahomes had a down game of 20 points. With Kareem Hunt and Melvin Gordon trending up, this team absolutely terrifies me.

> I think [Clyde Edwards-Helaire] is the most likely number two fantasy running back behind McCaffrey.

K-Man is gunning for the championship right now. After getting robbed of Alvin Kamara in the draft, he has to settle for Clyde Edwards-Helaire. This rookie looked right at home in the Chiefs' offense. I stand by my initial assessment of him. Chris Carson looked fantastic as well. If these two can stay healthy, I could see K-Man ending his playoff drought very soon.

I bet that Callen hasn't Venmo'd the $20 yet. Props to Caleb for firing on all cylinders week one. He rightfully earned the top spot, although I maintain that this is just an above-average team on most weeks. Raheem Mostert ate while I was concerned about the committee of RBs in San Francisco. David Johnson showed flashes of his old self. I wonder if he'd trade this win for a Broncos win.

The reigning champion has a well-balanced team. Tarv won convincingly even with some points left on his bench from Cam Newton and Jamison Crowder.

Man, I feel so bad for Logz this week. Putting up the second-highest score and still losing is one of the worst feelings ever. His team earned this spot, but I'm not super high on them going forward. This team is going to struggle when Josh Jacobs and JuJu aren't combining for 50 points. Outside of them plus Deshaun Watson, this team left a lot to be desired.

I think Mark's team underperformed this week but fully expect them to bounce back next week. He and I will be vying for the leftover rushing touchdowns after Lamar Jackson. It looks like he has won that battle with JK Dobbins getting the goal-line touchdowns. This team has a  high ceiling, but if Nick Chubb or AJ Dillion don't step up, I don't think he'll have what it takes to win the 'ship.

Andrew's team overperformed this week without a doubt. He's going to be salty about this, but I'm wary of teams who win based on a few dominant performances. Mark Andrews and Robbie Anderson aren't the core of a good team. Ronald Jones runs the risk of losing more carries to Leonard Fournette. Devin Singletary doesn't inspire confidence either.

> More importantly, maybe, is that I have a high upside rookie in Akers...

Davante Adams will be the best fantasy WR, but the rest of his team seems well-rounded at best right now. I was a Darius Slayton truther last year, but Callen left a quality game on the bench. There's a lot of potential here, but Callen desperately needs Austin Ekeler to go off to have a legitimate shot at the 'ship.

> My fantasy luck this week has been absolutely hilarious. Didn't realize Phillip Lindsay is done for the night. That's the final nail in my coffin.

As Sleeper already pointed out, I'm the worst manager in the league. I left a 30-piece sitting on the bench. I still see a lot of production on the team going forward, but it isn't who I initially planned for. It's almost certainly not enough to win me the championship either. This week, I was also incredibly unlucky with Henry Ruggs III and George Kittle playing through injury, Derrick Henry missing on two goal-line touchdowns, and Mark Ingram offering a lousy two points. Consider me humbled.

> There goes my season.

I should have never given Trond that much credit in my previous rankings. This season's only difference is that he's going to blame us for his terrible team since we drafted for him.

> Marlon Mack with a torn achilles. Coolcoolcool.

John's dire running back situation somehow got even worse. He's going to start shopping around for trades. Please remember that it's a violation of the league's constitution to trade with him.

> Only a few more passes to Fant and Carl will achieve the elusive "one player scores more than half your points in a single week" and "bench outscores your starting lineup" achievements in the same week. Truly impressive.

I'm stealing Callen's burn for my ranking description. F.
