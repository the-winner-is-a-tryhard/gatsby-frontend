### Week Three Points: 110.51

My team continues to consistently put up big numbers as a unit, with individual contributors varying week-to-week. Stafford is a top-5 QB as he finally change out the big D for vitamin D. It turns out that Ja'Marr chase was sandbagging during the preseason, much to my relief. But really, I'm being buoyed by Travis Kelce and the Saints' defense, both playing at the peak of their powers currently. There could be trouble on the horizon if my RBs don't find some level of consistency, but currently the outlook is 75 and sunny, just like it is for my boy Stafford. My team's soulfood is currently the avocado toast fueling Matt Stafford's LA renaissance.

Things are looking good for Cral right now. Since the world is now your oyster, you could travel to Philly to cheer on Jalen Hurts, your top-5 QB, in person, or go to Nashville to pay homage to the man, myth, and legend Derrick Henry. James Robinson looks to have finally come back online, hopefully Urban Meyer realizes that it's okay to help your rookie QB a little. MJJ, Keenan Allen, and Darren Waller have all been consistent and high-performing, but the real revelation has been Cooper Kupp's absolute dominance. Factor in a rising Tony Pollard and resurgent Brandon Aiyuk, and Cral's team is deep and dangerous. Carl's team's soulfood is Hot Fish from Bolton's Spicy Chicken & Fish in Nashville, because he's a spicyboi.

### Week Three Points: 127.92

John's team took a bit of a hit this week, but powered by his preseason trade with Cramsey (both the fact that he got Patrick Mahomes and the energy he absorbed from the trade itself), John remains in the upper echelon of the league. Mahomie continues to be a magician, despite KC's woes as a team. Zeke is still eating, Cordarrelle Patterson is a viable fantasy option because OF COURSE he is, he's on John's team, and TD Lockett will definetly bounce back from John's hubristic proclamation. The rest of John's starters are all solid on a week to week basis, even Cole "Heavy 1s" Beasley. Add in the fact that Josh Jacobs is bound to make a comeback, Zack Moss is making noise, and Diontae Johnson is also on his bench? John's team will just get better. John's team's soulfood is a burnt ends sandwich from Joe's Kansas City BBQ because even what are supposed to be the scraps are incredible.

### Week Three Points: 61.79

Even though A&M's fortunes were not so good this weekend, there was no such pain to numb in fantasy football for Travis. Tarv's team has been a bit of a rollercoaster through three weeks but finally in the upswing. Josh Allen, Saquon Barkley, and De'Andre Swift all made good on their potential week-to-week overwhelming for Cramsey to overcome. Although Tarv's triumvirate of former Alabama WR's was quiet on the day, they are still formidable and will bounce back. Javonte Williams looks like he's starting to come into his own. If some of Tarv's young guns (Sermon, Moore) or seasoned vets (Davis, Sanders) currently residing on his bench continue to hit, this will be a tough matchup for anyone. Tarv's teams soulfood is a basket of Cajun Honey Butter BBQ wings from Bar-Bill Tavern in Buffalo, because Josh Allen brought back the sweet heat this week.

### Week Three Points: 106.15

Trond's team is currently 4th in points for in our league, and a couple of bad bounces from being ranked even higher. Ironically, he got his first W this season in his worst showing. Trond's team is pretty consistent throughout, with multiple top-10 players (Lamar Jackson, Kareem Hunt, Davante Adams) holding things down and a couple of top-5 players (TJ Hockenson, Panthers D) boosting his performance in key positions. Although his top performers have room to get even better, his team was held back by some of the more lackluster players like Julio, Nyheim Hines, and JJSS. Additionally, Trond's bench looks slightly more reminiscent of a QB super-flex league than our current format. If his stars continue to shine bright and potentially brighter, Trond just might taste the post season this year, and not just as a spectator. Trond's team's soulfood is corned beef sandwich from Slyman's in Cleveland, because he really piled it on against Logz.

> I'm a bad manager.

### Week Three Points: 106.97

Fear not Claeb, for you are not a bad manager, just an unlucky one this week. Although you dropped a close one to Mark, you still sit 2-1 on the season with plenty of reasons for optimism. Aaron Rodgers seems to have found his way after a shaky debut. Chris Carson and Najee Harris are both looking like very solid running back options. Chris Godwin is back to his top-10 WR ways, and your hometown cooking is smelling pretty good with Melvin Gordon and the Denver D. You've got a lot of depth at WR, especially Juice comes back and AJ Green starts to look more like the 2012-2017 version of himself. If this team maintains consistency, it will certainly be in the playoff mix, but you'll just need to hope that you don't run into an RB depth issues. Claeb's team's soulfood is that classic Colorado BBQ, a slice of sumptuous brisket from Smok, because it will need to be slow and steady in order to have a shot.

| Name           | Team    | Depth |

### Week Three Points: 69.44

Although this quote was meant for Mrak's Cowboys, it could easily be applied to his fantasy football performance as well. His team has been a bit all over the place in terms of scoring through the first three weeks, but he finally managed to crack the top half of teams in scoring for this week and in doing so, secured his second W. Mark's team is full of boom/bust types, especially players like George Kittle who is dealing with QB uncertainty and general physical frailty, James Conner who is dealing with role uncertainty, and Chase Claypool whose QB has a wet noodle for an arm. Mrak's 11th hour "from the top rope with a galaxy brain WW pickup" of Alexander Mattison, as Travis so eloquently described, certainly helped him secure the bag this week and also helps mitigate against Dalvin Cook's puddin' ankles. On the theme of boom-bust, Chuba Hubbard could be huge for a stint as a Christian McCaffrey cosplayer, and Flash Gordon could either be that last complementary piece the Chef's have so desparately searched for or once again watch his opportunity go up in a puff of smoke. Mrak's team's soul food is a prix-fixe meal from Gorji Restaurant because much like Dak Prescott, it is in Dallas and has been described on Trip Advisor as "Hit or miss".

> Why are we the way that we are?

### Week Three Points: 73.05

A compelling question if there ever was one, and unfortunately, one to which there is not easy answer. Why did Russ stop cooking on the same day that Clydesdale decided to show up? Why is Robert Woods having his worst season in recent memory while the Ram's passing offense is otherwise thriving? How is Leonard Fournette still an active part of an NFL roster? Why do you have mutliple people on your bench that are not currently playing football? Alas, I digress. I think the Russ-to-DK connection with once again thrive, and I still do believe in Clyde and Miles Sanders. Your team has potential, and at this point in the season that's what matters. Also, not to belabor the point, but having players that play football on your roster helps too. Chris's team's soulfood is an Impossible Truffle Burger from Umami Burger in Seattle because much like your team, the future is through Seattle.

> Wrong Johnson.

### Week Three Points: 87.57

Unfortunately, Logz, I don't think that getting the right Johnson would've improved your outcome this week. The upside is that your notorious homer picks are paying off this season. Kyler Murray is the number one QB, and Sterling Shepherd was killing it before being slowed by injury. Nuks is still one of the top WR's, and I feel that his points will catch up with his skill. Laviska Shenault hasn't quite made the jump people were expecting, but there's still plenty of time. And looking at your bench, there are a lot of missed points due to injuries. At the very least, Henderson and Jeudy will come back to lead their respective teams, and Elijah Mitchell has a shot if OU traitor Trey Sermon can't make good on his second round pedigree. Much like Cramsey, I think this team will look better in the coming weeks as players start to heal up. Logz's team's soulfood is a margarita at Tarahumara's Mexican Cafe & Cantina in Norman, okay, because you may have to sip a few of those to pass the time before your team gets off the IR.

### Week Three Points: 95.42

Well, Carlough, at least you had a fantasy football W to return home to! It's actually kind of strange - on paper, this team looks much better than its performance to this point. But I suppose that's just the eyeball test. Justin Herbert had his best game by far, and it won't be his last. CMac is injured, but not placed on IR, so hopefully will be back to wrecking shop in short order. Antonio Gibson is showing signs of life after a slow start. Mike Evans and Gronk are benefitting from a high-powered Bucs passing attack, and Adam Thielen delayed his midlife crisis to have another sneaky good FF season. Michael Thomas could be a huge addition if he's even a shadow of his former self when (if?) he comes back. Kyle Pitts was a reach for the Falcons and also for you. Trust me, as a former lions fan taking a TE in the first round never works out like you hope. Mike Davis is a bowling ball that will not quit. Ruggs will be boom or bust, but you may get some huge game from him in relief of one of your other starters. Carlos' team's soulfood is a hot bowl of pho from Pho Real in Charlotte, NC, because he needs CMac to be sipping on whatever will make him feel better ASAP.

Callen's faith in A&M legend Ryan Tannehill has unfortunately not been rewarded, but it did take a step in the right direction. Fortunately for him, his RB's are stacked, with Kamara, Ekeler and A-Aron all capable of carrying this team at on a given week. Brandin Cooks will eat in the Texans offense because everyone else has died of hunger. CeeDee Lamb is going to finish as Cowboys WR1 in fantasy; pin it. Unfortunately, depth is an issue with Cal T's team. Devin Singletary is hit or miss in his time share with Zack Moss. Jared Cook is not the same as he has been in past years. Darnell Mooney has not lived up to the hype. Justin Fields and RoJo are painfully bad. I think if Tannehill gets back to how good he was last season and you get more help from your WR's, your RB's are good enough to carry this team to the doorstep of the playoffs. Callen's team's soulfood is a roast beef sandwich at the Arby's on the corner of Southwest Pkwy and Texas Ave in College Station, because he needs his RB's to show up.

Scottie's team should be good. It should be quite good. Unfortunately, this has not been the case thus far this season. He has not been in the upper half of the league in scoring any of the first three weeks. I am going to chalk that up to random luck, though, because his team has many of the right pieces, including the GOAT QB Tom Brady and a few good WR's (Deebo, JJ, A&M legend, and Callen Team castoff Christian Kirk) and a couple more that will return to being good (AJB, Diggs). Plus, I think Jonathan Taylor and Myles Gaskin are decent RB's, and Chase Edmonds is at least nominally a starter in a high-powered offense. Noah Fant and the Patriots D have both been under the radar good. I think this team will level out and make a push, but as he said in the trade talk channel, he needs some RB depth. Scottie's team's soulfood is a Rise And Grind smoothie from Raw Smoothie Co. in Tampa Bay, because homie needs TB12 to stay nourished; otherwise, he's in trouble.
