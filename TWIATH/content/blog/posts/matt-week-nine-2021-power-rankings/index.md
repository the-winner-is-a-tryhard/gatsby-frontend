### Week Nine Points: 91.98

Scottie wasn't quite able to pull out the win against Mark's season-high outburst, but he is still tied for the top record, number one in points for and has scored in the top half the league in the past three weeks. His team is buoyed by his studs (Tom Brady, soon to be number one RB Jonathan Taylor, and Deebo Samuel) while also getting servicable production from Justin Jefferson and Noah Fant (when he doesn't, you know, have COVID). AJ Brown will probably need to be relied on even more with the Titans missing Derrick Henry's production. So long as his stars stay healthy, he's got the firepower to stay on top.

### Week Nine Points: 73.99

My team was able to squeak out a win over Trond this weekend with Matthew Stafford salvaging what could've been a devastating fantasy performance. Stafford, Ja'Marr Chase, and Travis Kelce continue to be my team's MVP's, while other skill players (Moore, McLaurin, Harris) pitch in enough to keep me in contention. With Michael Carter on the rise and David Montgomery coming back from IR my team could be on the upswing, so long as DJ Moore and McLaurin can bounce back from their respective offenses' mini funks.

### Week Nine Points: 72.76

John's team's production has fallen off in recent weeks, but he's still bolstered in the standings by his blistering start to the season. His team as of late has been carried by Cordarelle Patterson in his 'Ice Ice Baby' Memorial One-Hit wonder season and the Sooners-to-Raven's pass-catching tandem of Marquise Brown and Mark Andrews. John would probably love to see Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs offense get back on track as well as Zeke get back to his early season success. Josh Jacobs seems to be bouncing back well from his earlier injury, and Tyler Lockett will benefit from having Russ back in the fold. If some things break right for John, this team could be right back in the mix of things.

### Week Nine Points: 84.23

Andrew Yang would've definitely provided some much needed RB depth to this squad, but Chris still got the W this weekend. The Oracle strikes again by starting Elijah Moore and Jordan Howard while getting just enough from everyone else to move to tied for first place. Things will be much better getting the Russ-to-DK connection back from injury and bye, respectively. Things could improve even further once Clyde comes back, and if Jeremy McNichols can get in on some of that post-Derrick Henry snap share, this team could continue its upward trajectory.

Callen just missed out scoring in the top half the league this week due to a down week across the board in fantasy football, but it was still enough to smoke Carl's squad. Jalen Hurts, his trio of top ten RBs and Hunter Henry all make this squad scary. Callen is very opportunistic as well, picking up Darrel Williams while CEH is on the shelf, nabbing AP out of the retirement home when Derrick Henry went down, and snagging ODB when he was jettisoned by the Browns to find greener pastures. All that while picking up A&M legend after Scottie unceremoniously dumped him. If Cooks and Lamb can continue with their solid years, this squad will continue to put numbers on the board and will at the very least contend for a PF spot in the playoffs.

Travis scored the second-most points this week on the backs of season-high marks from Devonta Smith, Pat Freiermuth and...the Dolphins defense? Regardless of the luck associated with the last one, the multitude of Tarv's rookie players seem to be hitting their stride right when it counts. Josh Allen will assuredly bounce back, Devontae Booker is filling in admirably for Saquon Barkley, who also happens to be waiting in the wings on Tarv's team. If D'Andre Swift can get his production back up, I don't think this is the last time we will see Tarv scoring in the upper echelon of the league.

### Week Nine Points: 120.74

Mark secured the bag this week in spite of Jonathan Taylor giving him quite the scare in the TNF game. Dak played a bad IRL football game but contibuted just enough from a fantasy perspective. Nick Chubb and James Connor both exploded, but unfortunately may be headed in opposite directions while Chubb navigates the COVID protocol and James Connor takes on a larger workload with Chase Edmonds' injury. Jakobi Meyers still does not have a regular season touchdown, and Chuba Hubbard's relevance is trending downward with the return of CMac, which all hurt the projections for this team moving forward. However, George "Brittle" Kittle returned to action for the first time in a month and looks to have picked up where he left off. If his starters can stay healthy, Mark will be right in the post-season mix.

### Week Nine Points: 80.30

It looks like Logan alpha-brained his backup QB situation, with Kirk Cousins filling in well for Kyler on his bye week. Joe Mixon continued on his top-five RB campaign, and although the decision to play two players widely considered to see an increase of action in their respective offenses (Bryan Edwards, Jerry Jeudy) didn't quite pan out, I think there is room for both to see more action on the back end of the season. Logan may be quietly creeping into the playoff picture looking in, and his team is still dangerous with Darrell Henderson and Deandre Hopkins on the slate to return.

### Week Nine Points: 54.64

Carl's team is spiraling at the moment. Outside of Joe Burrow, Darren Waller, and a superlative season from Cooper Kupp this team is comprised of backups and disappointments. Keenan Allen hasn't lived up to his normal standards, Kenny Golladay hasn't lived up to his offseason payday, and James Robinson looked to be on a roll before getting hurt. Hopefully he is back in short order though. Aside from those players, no one else is at the top of the depth chart of their respective positions on their teams (aside from Marvin Jones, I suppose, but being the best WR on the Jags right now is a low bar to clear). This team is going to have to hope for the Giants passing game to step it up (yikes) and James Robinson to return to full stength soon, otherwise this may be a lost season for Carl.

Andrew's team looks much better on paper than what's been reflected in its performance. Justin Herbert has built upon an exceptional and suprising rookie season, Michael Pittman and Mike Evans have both quietly been having top ten WR seasons, and Kyle Pitts is one of the first rookie TE's to appear to actually live up to the hype. Unfortunately, Christian McCaffrey and Antonio Gibson have both been slowed by injury, basically decimating his RB corps. If they can come back to full strength this team could make some noise, but will it be enough to overcome a slow first half of the season? Will Andrew seek to bolster his roster for a second half push or hold on to Michael Thomas as a sneaky keeper? Time will tell.

### Week Nine Points: 64.07

How this team has a 5-4 record despite having the lowest points for is astounding to me. Kudos to Caleb's fantasy defense for holding his opponents to the fourth-lowest points against in the league. A stellar rookie season from Najee Harris and breakout year for Mike Gesicki are what are keeping this team afloat at the moment. It does not help at all that Aaron Rodgers has COVID and is embroiled in controversy at the moment, or that Chris Carson and TY Hilton have been hurt for most of the season. If Jarvis Landry can soak up some extra targets without ODB, Chris Godwin can continue his underrated season and Allen Robinson can help Justin Fields by playing better football, this team can maybe squeak out enough wins to earn a playoff berth. If not, it might find its record reflecting the scores it has been putting up.

### Week Nine Points: 69.93

Trond's season has been a tale of two quarters. Through the first five weeks, he had scored in the upper half the league three out of five of the weeks. Ever since then his team has been in the basement. What happened? For starters, his WR corps, which were objectively the best in the league, have either cooled off, played inconsistently or suffered from injuries. His top three WR's (Mike Williams, Tyreek Hill, and Davante Adams) still can go toe-to-toe with anyone in the league, but he'll need consistency to compete. Lamar Jackson and TJ Hockenson are having solid seasons, but they can't make up for Trond's rough RB situation. Really his only option there is Kareem Hunt, who is currently on IR but is eligible to return soon. That can't happen soon enough for Trond, because the rest of his RB options are, as Logan has put it, "unstartable."
