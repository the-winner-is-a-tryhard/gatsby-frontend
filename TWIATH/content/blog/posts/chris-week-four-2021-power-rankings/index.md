### Week Four Points: 127.92

John’s magic from his preseason trade with the dingus that traded him Patrick Mahomes is starting to take shape. I am convinced that John is selling Chiefs and Cats losses to the football gods in exchange for fantasy dubs. Patty Ice Mahomes and Zeke are starting to heat up. The supporting cast carried their weight for the most part yet again. Even excluding Cordarrelle Patterson’s 30 burger on the bench, John managed 118 points. If John would have started Zack Moss in week 3, his team would be undefeated. Perhaps he should have changed his name to the Zack Squad that week. This team may seem inconsistent at times, but they aren’t. This team is very scary. Somebody please trade with this man to throw off his team balance. If the Zeke Squad stays inury-free, just send the weekly money winnings to John now.

> I had a team of all Lions players one year in FF. It probably would've worked better as a golf team.

### Week Four Points: 110.51

In my eyes, K-Man’s team is consistently very good. In 4 weeks, his scores have hit within a score range window of 104 - 111, which is tighter than a Lions fan’s bhole during that Justin Tucker walk off record-breaking field goal last week. Matthew Stafford is proving what everyone knew all along - the Lions really are that bad. Somehow, the Texans are worse. The good news for K-Man is his fantasy team is better than both of those teams combined. If you want to beat this team, you better bring your A-game.

### Week Four Points: 69.44

Brutal loss this week. So close, but yet so far. I hope you find solace in the fact that, sadly, starting one of your bench players would not have resulted in a win. Dalvin Cook really let you down this week. If he would have put up even half of his normal score you would have got the dub. In the land of the Wildcats, we call this a “Moral Victory”. This is what I prescribe to you to get over this loss. It doesn’t help. In all seriousness, I think this team is better than the record it has. I am not looking forward to playing against HCTM.

### Week Four Points: 61.79

Much like Jordan himself, another week another dub. While this week was not as dominant, a dub is a dub. Lots of points left on the bench which means this team as a whole, like A&M opponents of late, did not perform as poorly as  expected and regardless pulled out the victory. Tarv has given himself some padding in the W column. If this team can avoid the injury bug, it could work it’s way up into the upper-class of the league. If not, he may have to resort to his backups. I’d try to avoid that if I were you, we all know how that worked out for the Aggies.

### Week Four Points: 101.52

Scooter’s team drops 108 points including an 11 point dud from the most accomplished System Quarterback of all time: Tom Brady. Who in the world is Deebo Samuel and who’s throwing him the ball? This man out here averaging 16.5 points per game. At some point, you can’t call it a fluke anymore. I’m officially on the DEEBO TRAIN. Other than Miles “No Smiles” Gaskin, and the doo doo Dolphins defense, the rest of this team showed up this weekend. The depth of this team is NOT GREAT, BOB. But who cares when Noah Fant is averaging 7 points per game. I don’t know what it is, but it seems like this team is on the upward trend. Scottie is one Pecan Cold Brew away from taking his team to the next level.

> I don't want a guy on my team that I hate watching

### Week Four Points: 129.87

Much like Cral’s Snapchats, this team is a mixed bag that gets better every time you look at it. Cral unfortunately took the L this week, but I’ll need to see more disappointing weeks for me to count this team out. Cooper Kupp had his first “disappointing” outing and he wasn’t the only one. The receiving corps looked more like a receiving corpse. Marvin Jones may be in for a long season if Urban Meyer can’t keep himself out of trouble, but DJ Chark out for the season after getting steamrolled by his teammate could help a bit. Despite all of this, I don’t want to play against this team. Derrick Henry is an absolute galactico tank. I expect Uncle Cral’s Little Dogs will be in every game it plays.

> And that was the only happiness I experienced that day

### Week Four Points: 106.97

I must admit, like the Denver Broncos, I am somewhat skeptical of this team. But I cannot deny the 3-1 record. Save Najee Harris, this was a rough week for the RBs. When Mike Gesicki is outscoring the combined score of Melvin Gordon and Chris Carson, we got problems. But much like the Broncos of early, you still waved the victory flag. The schedule is heating up against the Zeke Squad next week, but unlike the Broncos, this team does have the ceiling to beat any team in the league on any given night. If the stars align, Claeb’s team could make some moves upward.

> Find me three wins on the A&M schedule and I'll give you a dollar

### Week Four Points: 121.52

I think that this is a case of good team with bad luck at the moment. I’d say Callen left too many points on the bench, but John had a sleeping giant on his bench as well. Exactly like A&M has discovered multiple times this year, Callen found himself in a game he was truly outplayed in. I can’t at 1-3, but I really wanted to rank this team higher. Ekeler is a beast this year, and if things start clicking the Guzzlers could easily move up to near the top of the rankings by season end. I believe Callen has the eye of the tiger that Jimbo lacks, and unlike the Fightin’ Texas Aggie football team, will claw his way back potentially into a playoff spot.

### Week Four Points: 95.42

Trash, indeed. Sort of like Mike Davis, Adam Thielen, Henry Ruggs and Michael Pittman this week. If I had a dollar for every time Henry Ruggs dropped a pass last night I would have a whole lotta money. Gronk being out hurt this team a bit, but he should be back in a couple weeks. If Adam Thielen and Mike Davis start going back to their old ways, Andrew’s team could become a bit dangerous. But at 1-3, this team has some work to do to get out of the hole they’ve dug for themselves.

### Week Four Points: 106.15

Not a lot to say here. Tyreek Hill scored nearly half the points and Trond's team still lost by 10. Granted, that can happen when you start players that aren’t planning to take the field. Nyheim Hines went all-out with a -0.90 contribution. I think there’s some potential here but if Georgia Tech football has taught us anything over the years, it’s that trying the same thing that’s not working over and over again doesn’t work. Lots of games left but this team needs to shake some things up to light a rally spark

### Week Four Points: 87.57

In true character of a proper GLOATS Team Lead, Logz managed to start a player listed as OUT and garner negative points from his defense thanks to his starting QB. The saving grace for this team this week is that DJ Chark got truck-sticked in the ankle and, now that he’s out for the season. This could open the game for Shenault a little bit. That is if Urban Meyer isn’t too hungover on gameday. Rough start but enough games left to turn it around with some Waiver Wire magic.

### Week Four Points: 73.05

This team breaks my heart week-in and week-out. It seems like we are never healthy, and when we are the ball just doesn’t bounce our way on 50/50 plays. I’ve told myself for years that I love this team no matter what, and I do, but all I know is pain. I feel like that little A&M dog laying on the turf with tears in its eyes.. but for me.. the tears represent pain, but also love. I will forever be a Wildcat #EMAW  Now for my fantasy team. This is unequivocally the most fraudulent team on the face of the planet. I simply cannot rely on my defense to score this many points per week if I want to make the playoffs. DJ Chark out for the season 3 plays into the game. Big Brain Jimmy Neutron moves starting him at the last second. Les Miles could probably manage this team better than I have been. I’m gonna have to find my way onto the waiver wire at some point otherwise I’m one injury away from becoming publicly exposed as the fraud I am.
